In the past hypothesis-driven research in the life sciences has been the domain of experimental biologists, with the role of biostatisticians and bioinformaticians being one of support. This is no longer the case. As the “data-deluge” continues my research interests have focused on how to use biological “big-data” in order to create and test hypotheses.

My primary research interest is in understanding how genes and drugs can coordinate changes in cellular phenotypes and use this to treat disease or initiate transdifferentiation. I have approached this problem through the integration of varied data sources, the development of algorithms and close collaboration with experimental scientists.
